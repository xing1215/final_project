Project Title
-------------

At this point, we have not decided which topic we are going to do, but we have several interested topics

A. The negative impacts of E-cigarettes in adolescence \* Early-onset of smoking behavior \* increasing risks of addiction/reliance
- Biological evidence is insufficient. So, we need more statistical and epidemiological results to show the negative association between e-cigarettes usage and the health condition of adolescence. - From NY Times: “San Francisco Bans Sale of Juul and Other E-Cigarettes”

B. Videogames - The relationship between playing videogames and real-life gun violence

Motivation
----------

Adolescence is the future of the country. We care about their health condition, both physical and mental. Investigating factors influencing their health helps us to know the group more comprehensive and to address problems better.

Intended final products
-----------------------

We intend to deliver a website addressing the negative impact of e-cigarettes in adolescence. In the website, we have several sections to show our raw dataset, after-cleaning dataset, research questions, analysis methods, and conclusions. \#\# Anticipated data sources

We will retrieve datasets from Office on Smoking and Health (OSHData) in the CDC website: <https://www.cdc.gov/oshdata/>

Planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges
-------------------------------------------------

Analyses challenges could be unknowing analysis methods. We have limited knowledge about building and plotting models and this information may not support our intention. Visualization challenges could be choosing a proper plot to convey information we think is significant. Coding challenges could appear in many stages. One could be too much unnecessary and inaccurate information in the raw dataset.

Planned timeline
----------------

-   To Nov 8th: choose a proper dataset in the topic we are interested in
-   11/11/2019 - 11/15/2019: discuss proper ways to clean our dataset and figure out the model we are going to use; start working on coding; attending the project review meeting
-   11/16/2019 - 11/27/2019: coding; revising; discussing
-   11/28/2019 - 12/01/2019: having a great rest and enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday!
-   12/02/2019 - 12/04/2019: coding; revising; discussing; writing the report
-   12/05/2019: submit all deliverables: report, webpage, screencast, and peer assessment
